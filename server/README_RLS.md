# 🔐 Row Level Security (RLS) - Complete Setup

## ✨ Status: FULLY CONFIGURED AND VERIFIED

Your Neon PostgreSQL database is now protected with Row Level Security (RLS). All policies have been verified and are active.

---

## 📊 What's Protected

### ✅ 11 Tables with RLS Enabled
- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `invoices` - Medical service invoices
- `medical_records` - Patient medical records (HIPAA-grade protection)
- `prescriptions` - Medication prescriptions
- `payment_records` - Payment transactions
- `insurance_packages` - Available insurance plans
- `patient_insurance` - Patient insurance coverage
- `insurance_package_services` - Insurance service coverage details
- `institution_staff` - Healthcare institution staff management
- `products` - Medical products and services
- `transactions` - Blockchain transaction records

### ✅ 33 Security Policies Active
Every table has granular policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations based on user roles.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Verify RLS Status Anytime
```bash
npm run verify:rls
```

### 2. Start Your Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Make Authenticated Requests
```bash
# Include user's wallet address in header
curl -H "x-user-address: 0xYourWalletAddress" \
  http://localhost:4000/api/invoices
```

---

## 🔑 Authentication

All protected endpoints require a wallet address in the request headers:

```typescript
// Option 1: x-user-address header (recommended)
headers: {
  'x-user-address': '0x1234...'
}

// Option 2: Authorization header
headers: {
  'authorization': 'Bearer 0x1234...'
}
```

- ✅ View own insurance coverage
- ✅ View available insurance packages and products
- ❌ Cannot access other patients' data

### DOCTOR

- ✅ Create prescriptions and invoices
- ✅ View related payment records
- ❌ Cannot access other doctors' patients

### INSTITUTION

## 📡 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth | Returns |
|----------|------|---------|
| `GET /health` | ❌ | Server health status |
| `GET /api/profile` | ✅ | User's profile |

## 💻 Using RLS in Your Code

### In Express Routes

```typescript
import { rlsMiddleware } from './middleware/rls.middleware';

// Protected route - requires authentication
app.get('/api/data', rlsMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // RLS context is automatically set
  const data = await prisma.yourModel.findMany();
  // Only returns data user can access
  res.json(data);
});
```

### Manual RLS Context

```typescript
import { setRLSContext } from './lib/rls';

// Set context manually
await setRLSContext(prisma, userWalletAddress);
const data = await prisma.invoice.findMany();
```

### With Callback Wrapper

```typescript
import { withRLSContext } from './lib/rls';

const result = await withRLSContext(prisma, userAddress, async () => {
  return await prisma.invoice.findMany();
});
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test RLS Protection

```bash
# 1. Without authentication (should fail)
curl http://localhost:4000/api/invoices
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# 2. With authentication (should succeed)
curl -H "x-user-address: 0x123..." http://localhost:4000/api/invoices
# Expected: User's invoices

# 3. Different user addresses see different data
curl -H "x-user-address: 0xPATIENT123" http://localhost:4000/api/invoices
curl -H "x-user-address: 0xDOCTOR456" http://localhost:4000/api/invoices
# Each returns different results based on access rights
```

### Verify Database Policies

```bash
# Run verification script
npm run verify:rls

# Should show:
# ✅ 11/11 tables with RLS
# ✅ 33 policies active
# ✅ Helper function present
```

## 🔍 Database Verification

### Check RLS in Neon Console

Connect to your Neon database and run:

```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename != '_prisma_migrations';

-- Expected: All 11 tables with rowsecurity = true

-- View all policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Expected: 33 policies

-- Test the helper function
SELECT set_current_user_address('0xTestAddress');
SELECT current_setting('app.current_user_address', true);
```

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Always use middleware** for consistent RLS application
2. **Test with different user roles** to verify access control
3. **Monitor query performance** - RLS adds query complexity
4. **Never disable RLS in production** - it's your last line of defense
5. **Keep policies simple** for better performance
6. **Run verification regularly** - `npm run verify:rls`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### No Data Returned
- ✅ Verify RLS context is set: `npm run verify:rls`
- ✅ Check user address matches database records
- ✅ Ensure correct header format

### 401 Unauthorized
- ✅ Add `x-user-address` header to request
- ✅ Verify wallet address format (0x...)

### Performance Issues
- ✅ Add indexes on foreign key columns
- ✅ Simplify complex policies if needed
- ✅ Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to debug queries

### RLS Not Working
- ✅ Run verification: `npm run verify:rls`
- ✅ Check middleware is applied to routes
- ✅ Verify headers are being sent
